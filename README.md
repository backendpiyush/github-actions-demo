## 1. GitHub Actions Fundamentals

- **Core Concepts**: Understand workflows, events, jobs, steps, actions, and runners.  
- **Workflow Files**: Learn YAML syntax, file location (`.github/workflows/`), naming conventions, file structure, and validation.  

---

## 2. Workflow Configuration

- **Triggers & Events**: Setup workflows for `push`, `pull_request`, scheduled runs (`cron`), manual triggers (`workflow_dispatch`), and webhooks.  
- **Job Configuration**: Define runners (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`), set job dependencies with `needs`, use conditional execution, environment variables, and default settings.  

---

## 3. Actions and Steps

- **Using Actions**: Use pre-built actions from the GitHub Marketplace with proper versioning (tags or commit SHAs), and configure inputs/outputs.  
- **Types of Actions**: JavaScript actions for lightweight tasks and Docker actions for containerized environments.  
- **Common Built-in Actions**: `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`, `actions/cache`, `upload-artifact`, `download-artifact`, and GitHub CLI integration.  

---

## 4. Workflow Control

- **Conditional Execution**: Control jobs and steps with expressions, context data, and status checks (`if:`).  
- **Job Orchestration**: Define sequential or parallel jobs, use matrix strategies for parallel testing, create reusable workflows, and manage concurrency.  

---

## 5. Working with Code âœ…

- **Repository Interaction**: Checkout repository code, access branch and commit metadata, and use secrets securely.  
- **Build & Test Automation**: Automate running tests, collect code coverage, and upload artifacts for reports and logs.  

---

## 6. Deployment Workflows

- **Deployment Basics**: Use `environment:` keyword for deploy targets, set manual approvals, and automate GitHub Releases.  
- **Common Deployment Targets**: Deploy to GitHub Pages, AWS, Azure, Docker registries, and package managers like npm, PyPI, Maven.  

---

## 7. Workflow Optimization

- **Performance Tips**: Cache dependencies with `actions/cache`, split jobs to run in parallel, reuse artifacts, and implement selective testing.  
- **Cost & Usage**: Monitor runner minutes, understand limits, use self-hosted runners for heavy workloads, and optimize matrix builds.  

---

## 8. Security Practices

- **Secret Management**: Manage secrets at repository, environment, and organization levels with masking in logs.  
- **Permission Control**: Scope `GITHUB_TOKEN` with least privilege, lock down third-party actions, and use protected environments.  

---

## 9. Practical Patterns

- **CI Patterns**: Validate pull requests, enforce branch protection rules, and automate code reviews.  
- **CD Patterns**: Automate environment promotion (staging â†’ production), support rollbacks, and implement feature flags.  

---

## 10. Workflow Debugging

- **Troubleshooting**: Use logs, enable debug secrets (`ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG`), and run workflows locally with tools like `act`.  
- **Maintenance**: Keep actions updated and pinned to specific versions, maintain YAML files under version control, and document workflows properly.

This guide provides a structured learning path to master GitHub Actions from basic concepts to complex workflow management, ensuring automation pipelines are reliable, secure, and efficient.
